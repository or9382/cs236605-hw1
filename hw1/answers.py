part2_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
No.  
In fact increasing k only helps sometimes in the low values, and then quickly makes the accuracy worse.  
That is because when using a value for k that is too large we are underfitting the model.  
That happens because we are looking at too many points in the training set, even those that are too far away.

"""

part3_q3 = r"""
**Your answer:**
1) Based on the graph of the training set loss We would say that  
our learning rate is **good** as the value of the average loss converged to  
small values under 1 after 5-10 epochs and kept getting better afterwards.  
If the learning rate was **too low** the graph would show much slower convergence,  
and if the learning rate was **too high** the loss would probably not converge at all.  
  
2) Based on the graph of the Training and validation sets' accuracy we would say that  
the model is **slightly overfitted to the training set** as we can see that  
the accuracies of the 2 sets converge into 2 different values, and the test set's value  
is slightly higher than the validation set's.
