part2_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
No.  
In fact increasing k only helps sometimes in the low values, and then quickly makes the accuracy worse.  
That is because when using a value for k that is too large we are underfitting the model.  
That happens because we are looking at too many points in the training set, even those that are too far away.
